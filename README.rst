furry-parakeet: C kernels and wrappers for image combination
############################################################

This repository contains the linear algebra and interpolation kernels used by `PyIMCOM <https://github.com/Roman-HLIS-Cosmology-PIT/pyimcom>`_.

Installation
============

You should be able to pip install by going to the ``furry-parakeet`` directory and running::

    pip install .

This uses the Numpy/C API. If you want to adjust the default settings for C compilers, you can edit ``setup.py`` (for example: openmp is enabled by default).

Legacy versions
===============

Previous versions of ``furry-parakeet`` installed each file as a python module, so you would import with ``import pyimcom_croutines``. You would now write ``from furry_parakeet import pyimcom_croutines``. You can make code that would be compatible with either using::

    try:
        from furry_parakeet import pyimcom_croutines
    except ImportError:
        import pyimcom_croutines

Helpful information
===================

There are `interface instructions <docs/interface_instructions.rst>`_ if you are interested in how ``furry-parakeet`` can interface with other tools in the Roman ecosystem.

You can also look at the `readthedocs page <https://furry-parakeet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
