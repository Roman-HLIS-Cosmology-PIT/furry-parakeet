You first need to make the file:

IncludePaths.txt

that lists the path for the numpy C header. On OSC, this is

/apps/python/3.7-2019.10/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/

If you want to use the Intel Math Kernel Library, set the MKL_CFLAGS and MKL_LIBS environment variables.

Then do the setup:

python setup.py clean --all
python setup.py build
python setup.py install --prefix=~/local/furry-parakeet/

(You may change the prefix to your install location.)

To use the kernel, you will first want to include furry-parakeet in your PYTHONPATH:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/local/furry-parakeet/lib/python3.7/site-packages

and then you can import it:

import pyimcom_lakernel

If you want you can try interpolating a plane wave:

pyimcom_lakernel.testkernel(3.,[.2,.1])
