You first need to make the file:

IncludePaths.txt

that lists the path for the numpy C header. On OSC, this is

/apps/python/3.7-2019.10/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/

If you want to use the Intel Math Kernel Library, set the MKL_CFLAGS and MKL_LIBS environment variables.

Then do the setup:

pip install --use-feature=in-tree-build .

This will install pyimcom_croutines, pyimcom_lakernel, and pyimcom_interface.

If you want you can try interpolating a plane wave:

import pyimcom_lakernel
pyimcom_lakernel.testkernel(3.,[.2,.1])

To use the interface to coadd images, you can try

import pyimcom_interface

(see InterfaceInstructions.txt for a list of functions)

You can do an example by making the 'out/' directory and using the testdither.py script:

python testdither.py sample_config.txt

If you want to remove these routines, you can use:

pip uninstall furryparakeet
